                    <div class="description">One attaining higher education can mean achieving one’s dreams, living flourishing lives, and being rewarded for one’s commitments. However, the relationship between happiness and education can rather become tainted, where higher levels of education no longer associate with higher levels of happiness, due to increased levels of stress, competition, and anxiety.
