            Canadian Party Leaders&#39; Uncertain Future: a Looming Threat

            As I and many others predicted, the unsurprising result of the 2021 snap election was another Liberal minority. Although parliament is now back in session, it is apparent that a looming cloud hangs over the heads of the party leaders. <br><br>

The future for most of Canada’s political leaders is uncertain. <br><br>

<b>Annamie Paul</b><br>
After coming off the Green Party’s best election performance ever in the 2019 Federal Election, long time party leader Elizabeth May made the decision to resign. What ensued was a costly and inefficient race to find a replacement. The result was the bilingual diplomat Annamie Paul. Her victory marks the first time a party leader was black or of Jewish faith. <br><br>

However, her ascent to party leader was not as graceful as she might have expected. At the peak of the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflicts, her one-sided response left a bad taste in many of her party members’ mouths. One such example was Jenica Attwin, who in response to her comments switched her allegiance to the Liberal Party of Canada. <br><br>

All this was furthered by a growing sense of rebellion within the party, where many sought to remove her from the position. By August, it was almost certain that she would not make it to the scheduled 2023 election. <br><br>

Yet, a snap election triggered by Trudeau later that month forced her to stay. <br><br>

Now with the party’s insignificant showing in the election, Paul made the decision to resign. However, to this day her resignation is not official, and she remains party leader. Many speculate that her replacement would be given to long-term Green candidate Paul Manly, after Elizabeth May stated that she would not act as interim leader. <br><br>

<b>Erin O’Toole and Maxime Bernier</b><br>
Andrew Scheer’s time as leader swiftly came to an end after he was unable to defeat Trudeau in 2019; similarly, the future does not look so bright for Erin O’Toole. O’Toole’s unclear attempt to brand the party as something more palatable to Canadian Voters ended up backfiring. The way he flipped back and forth on many issues only led Canadians to distrust his intentions and policies. <br><br>

By doing so, he proceeded to isolate parts of his conservative base through progressive pandering and turn off left wing voters through blatant lies. His attempt to spread the popularity of the party only drove a fraction of his base to Maxime Bernier’s newly established People’s Party of Canada. <br><br>

With many rural voters possessing deep disdain towards vaccine and mask mandates, Bernier quickly found his niche this election. A rather strong 5% showing this year guarantees him a spot at the debate stage next election. It’s clear Bernier is not heading out, and O’Toole may not be as well. <br><br>

The party itself is divided, with many fearing the dangerous precedent it sets to have a leader who has won the popular vote and 1/3 of seats be removed because they did not become Prime Minister. Others believe that O’Toole’s message simply did not connect with Canadians, and it is time to move on. <br><br>

<b>Jagmeet Singh</b><br>
Singh’s future is a lot more complex than the others. Although it is true that he gained more seats than the previous election, it wasn’t by a large margin, and it falls short of many progressive voters’ expectations. <br><br>

Singh can’t seem to jump the hurdle that Quebec poses. In both elections, he has fallen short in that region, and it's not certain whether a third try would merit a better outcome. <br><br>

However, support for Singh from within the NDP is strong. Unlike the Green Party, it is one of the most unified parties in Canada. <br><br>

<b>Justin Trudeau</b><br>
Trudeau has been given a second minority government and has fallen short twice from a desired majority. However, there seems to be no talent within the Liberal Caucus to replace him aside from Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland. Although, when Liberal voters were polled on whether they would prefer Freeland to Trudeau, Trudeau came out on top. <br><br>

Canadian politics remains in a state of limbo after this election’s unsurprising result, but perhaps all it needs to spark some interest are a few new faces.
