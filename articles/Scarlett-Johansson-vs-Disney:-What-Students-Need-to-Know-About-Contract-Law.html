            Scarlett Johansson vs Disney: What Students Need to Know About Contract Law

            The essence of the dispute between Disney and Scarlett Johansson is not foreign to young students entering the workforce. Many companies that choose to hire young workers take advantage of their lack of legal knowledge. It is important that students understand the basics of contract law to protect their rights.<br><br> 

After Marvel’s Black Widow was given a concurrent release in both movie theaters and on Disney+, Scarlett Johansson and her legal team filed a shocking lawsuit against Marvel’s parent company Disney. Although the decision seemed sudden to the public, it was not for Disney and new CEO Bob Chapek, who ignored clear warning signs. It has been reported that Ms. Johansson’s team reached out several times to the entertainment giant requesting that they meet to renegotiate the terms of their deal; however their requests were simply ignored. Even when the head of the CAA reached out to Bob Chapek himself, his pleas were rejected. <br><br>

There is no argument to be had regarding whether Johansson had the right to file this lawsuit–– Disney broke their end of the contract. The fact that a party broke their end of a legally binding deal does not change if the either side has a net worth of 10 dollars or 10 billion dollars. In fact, Disney knew this. With the concurrent release of Disney’s Jungle Cruise, they were quick to renegotiate the contract of star Dwayne Johnson, who had a similar agreement. However, they refused to do so with Johansson. Let’s analyze this situation to explain the basics of contract law. <br><br>

Put simply, there are 4 essential elements found in all contracts: <br><br>

An Offer: A proposition where both parties gain something, whether that be services money, etc. <br>
Acceptance: Both parties must accept and commit to their respective sides of the agreement.<br>
Consideration: When something of value is given to the party in exchange for their promises made in the contract. <br>
Capacity: Both parties must have capacity to agree, meaning they cannot be under the influence, and must be of legal age.<br><br>

Using the Scar-Jo situation as an example, Disney asked Johansson to act in their movie (offer), both parties signed and accepted the offer (acceptance), in exchange for her services, she would receive a salary and box office bonus (consideration), and both parties were of legal age and had the ability to agree (capacity). <br><br>

However, it must be noted that some contracts do NOT have to be written. They CAN be verbal. <br><br>

Now, with a basic understanding of what makes up a contract we can understand the essence of the dispute: when can one break a contract? Let’s run through a few scenarios. <br><br>

<b>Breach of Contract:</b><br>
The most obvious condition is called breach of Contract. This is when a party does not follow up with their end of the agreement. For example, in the Scar-Jo situation, Johansson fulfilled her end of the deal. She acted in the film, produced the film, and marketed the film; however, Disney did not fulfill their promise to provide her with a bonus based on box-office earnings. When this happens, the result is predictably a lawsuit. <br><br>

<b>Impossibility of Performance:</b><br>
We must also consider if Disney could declare they had the Impossibility of Performance. This condition indicates when one party has no choice and can no longer provide the services agreed upon in the deal. In a situation where Johansson was unable to act because of a horrible car accident, and Disney had not paid her yet, they could void the contract. However, in this situation, Johansson had already provided her services by acting, and Disney had made the choice to alter the agreement after the fact. <br><br>

<b>Reasonable Reliance:</b><br>
It is important to note that many argue that it was not explicitly stated that the film would be granted an exclusive theatrical release; however, the concept of reasonable reliance disproves this. This condition indicates that a statement in a contract can be reasonably anticipated or foreseen. For example, when Johansson signed the contract, the term theatrical release was predicted as following the formula outlined by the previous 23 Marvel Movies. That is, an exclusive theatrical release for 3 months. This principle illustrates that it was clear that the plaintiff’s understanding of the contract was a full exclusive theatrical release. <br><br>

<b>The Statute of Frauds:</b><br>
Next, there is the Statute of Frauds. This legal principle indicates that certain contracts must be evidenced in writing. The types of contracts included varies by province, but they are generally summarized by the acronym “My Legs:” Marriage, Year, Land, Executor, Guarantor, and Sales (more than $500). It is important that students understand this rule when committing to agreements. If any of those 6 criteria are met, make sure that the contract is evidenced in writing. <br><br>

So, will Johansson get paid? <br><br>

With the lawsuit heading to certain arbitration, it is almost inevitable that the two sides will settle. However, what should students keep in mind when they are entering legal agreements? <br><br>

First, remember the building blocks of a contract. Ensure that there is an offer, acceptance, consideration, and capacity. Second, if one side breaches an article in the contract you can file a suit forcing them to uphold their consideration. Third, if you are unable to perform your side of a contract, and you have not received consideration, you can void the contract under Impossibility of Performance. Fourth, one cannot use semantics to change the meaning of an article in a contract, this is protected by reasonable reliance. Fifth, remember “My Legs” and understand when contracts must be signed on paper and are evidenced in writing. Lastly, don’t forget, not all contracts have to be in writing! <br><br>

These ideas are important to keep in mind when looking for work. Don’t let employers take advantage of you as a student!
