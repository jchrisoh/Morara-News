            A Student&#39;s Experience at a Film Festival

            The dream of almost every filmmaker is to have their work be shown on the big screen. Whether that be in the movie or home theater, there is nothing like seeing the result of your hours of effort screened to a full audience. Often, a stepping stone to achieving this goal is Film Festivals, where filmmakers are welcome to submit their work to be possibly chosen to be a part of the festival. At these festivals, filmmakers can grow their networks, connect with fellow movie fanatics, and win awards. <br><br>

As an aspiring filmmaker, I got the chance, this past January, to have my original Short Film: “Stuck,” be played at a Vancouver-based festival. The Vancouver Short Film Festival was an amazing experience, even if it may have been altered because of COVID-19 restrictions. Originally meant to be screened in front of an audience, I was ecstatic to share my project with the world. However, with new health restrictions, the festival was migrated to an online only format. <br><br>

Although it was initially disappointing to lose the in-person experience I had patiently awaited, the online festival blew away all my expectations. Everything was seamlessly migrated to the digital world and was organized swiftly. All the films could be conveniently accessed and streamed. However, above all, I was mesmerized by the digital events they held over Zoom. <br><br>

First, there was a filmmaker coffee-hour, where we were able to meet, and chat with a variety of different people and learn more about their projects. This was a great chance to grow my connections, and network. Second, there was a live watch party for the After Dark Films. These films were the experimental, horror, and what some may call “weird” films. My film found itself in this category, and it was truly awesome to watch it with a group of fellow filmmakers over Zoom. Lastly, there was the Awards Show. Although I didn’t win anything, the presentation was simply outstanding, and I couldn’t be prouder of all the winners. <br><br>

I think this experience goes to prove that if you have the urge to make something like a short film, you should go out and do it. I spent a portion of my summer crafting this movie and decided to send it out to a few local festivals. I was shocked to be accepted into this one and couldn’t have been happier to be a part of it. Don’t let whatever limitations you have stop you from making a movie, book, or settle whatever creative itch you have. We often use the fact that we don’t have gear, proper editing software, or actors as excuses. However, the truth is that the most important part of any film is the story. If you can write and tell a compelling one, you are already more than halfway there. <br><br>

Students have the ability to pull inspiration from their daily lives. Living and surviving high school takes a lot of courage, and everyday presents new obstacles. If you want to write a story, or make a film, often pulling from personal stories makes the job a lot easier. <br><br>

I am incredibly grateful to say that my first ever Film Festival Experience was with the Vancouver Short Film Fest. I hope that it is not my last foray into the film industry.
