            How the 2021 AP Exams were Different and How You can be Prepared for Future Exams

            Many students have received their AP scores in the past weeks. Scores for exams taken in Administration 1 and Administration 2 were available starting Wednesday, July 21, and most scores for exams taken in Administration 3 and Administration 4 will be available by August 16. <br><br>

<b>What is AP?</b><br>
AP (Advanced Placement) offers students an opportunity to take college-level courses in high school. Usually, a score of 3 or above can be exchanged for college credit. Taking AP courses helps students to prepare for the intense workload in universities, save money and time, and discover their passions. Strong AP scores can increase students’ GPA and help students stand out in college applications. <br><br>

<b>How are the 2021 AP Exams Different From Those of Past Years?</b><br>
AP exam in 2021 had three administrations, administration 1 (May 3–7, 10–12, 14, 17 In School), administration 2 (May 18–21, 24–28 In School and At Home), and administration 3 (June 1–4, 7–11 In School and At Home). Traditional pencil and paper exams were given in Administration 1. Both pencil and paper exams and virtual exams were given in Administration 2 and 3. <br><br>

Last year, all AP exams were administered online. The AP exams before 2020 were traditional pencil and paper exams. In an effort to protect the integrity of AP exams and also protect the safety of students, the College Board proceeded to provide AP exams both in school and digitally this year. <br><br>

This year, there was a general decrease in the percentage of students who scored a 4 or a 5 on the exams. Some students also chose to cancel their exam scores, which could be attributed to the decrease in preparation time and change in exam format. Students who had their AP courses in quarter 3 and quarter 4 did not have much time to study for their exams, while students who took the course in quarter 1 or 2 could have forgotten the course material. Others found it difficult to adapt to virtual AP exam policies, such as not being able to go back to preceding questions and change the answer. <br><br>

However, some students also responded positively. They believe the quarter system tightened their schedule and helped their progress <br><br>

<b>How to Prepare for AP Exams</b><br>
<b>Resources on the College Board’s Website</b><br>
The College Board posts past free-response questions, examples, and scoring rules on its website. This is probably one of the best resources for FRQ questions. In addition, more AP exam-style questions can be found in the AP classroom, which is accessible to students who have a College Board account and are enrolled in an AP course. <br><br>

<b>Khan Academy</b><br>
Khan Academy provides instructional videos for multiple AP subjects, such as AP Psychology, AP Economics, AP Calculus, and many more. These videos can serve as helpful complements to the classes taught by school teachers. Students can also self-study AP courses based on these resources. <br><br>

<b>Barron's</b><br>
Barron’s is one of the most renowned practice books for AP Exams. It does a good job of organizing the important facts that students need to remember, which saves students time in preparation. Barron’s books also contain mock AP exams, answers, and explanations. <br><br>

<b>AP Exam Awards</b><br>
The College Board gives out awards to students with outstanding performances. 

<br><br>
 
<b>AP Scholar</b>: Granted to students who receive scores of 3 or higher on three or more AP Exams.<br>
<b>AP Scholar with Honor</b>: Granted to students who receive an average score of at least 3.25 on all AP Exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on four or more of these exams.<br>
<b>AP Scholar with Distinction</b>: Granted to students who receive an average score of at least 3.5 on all AP Exams taken, and scores of 3 or higher on five or more of these exams.
