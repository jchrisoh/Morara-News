            Wilson Miao&#39;s Message to Students: The Future is For You

            Wilson Miao is the Liberal candidate for Richmond Centre. He moved here in 1996 with his family and he’s been a proud resident in Richmond Centre for the past 25 years. While residing in the Richmond Centre area, he came to recognize a lot of growth and changes to the community, such as the increase in immigration, which he attributes to the district’s clean air and profound support for elderly care. He is incredibly grateful to be part of such a community and believes it to be an honour to be living in Richmond Centre. <br><br>

<b>What made you decide to run for office in the Richmond Centre riding?</b><br>
“It comes from my passion.” <br><br>

Having ample experience as a local media publication director, Mr. Miao has come to realize the many needs that his community waits for. Thus far, Mr. Miao has had conversations with local non-profit organizations and businesses which has allowed him to become closer with voters in his close-knit community. Through diverse interactions, Mr. Miao has felt the need to help locals with overcoming both preexisting and future challenges by running for office. <br><br>

<b>Why is it important for youth to be educated about this federal election even though the majority of them are ineligible to vote? </b><br>
“In order for students to be able to make changes, they need to first be aware of the system. It’s important for students to voice their opinions because the future is for [them].” <br><br>

After graduating from Richmond Secondary School, Mr. Miao realized the power of voting. He believes in Canada, a democratic country in which Canadians are entitled to free expression, all citizens should embrace their voting privileges. Moreover, he emphasizes that a concrete understanding of the political system in Canada is the very first step for students to share their voice. <br><br>

<b>What is your priority or goal if you are elected?</b><br>
“I will advocate strongly for seniors because without them, we wouldn’t be here.” <br><br>

Mr. Miao stresses that affordable retirement is vital to Richmond Centre seniors, who he claims have endured great hardships these past years––especially during the pandemic. Mr. Miao strives to relieve Canadian seniors, who he mentions are worthy of a humane environment and high-quality treatment, of their suffering from living in isolation and from mental illnesses. <br><br>

Aside from advocating for seniors, Mr. Miao also plans to tackle climate change and ensure community safety. <br><br>

<b>What do you think are some pressing issues in Richmond Centre, and how do you plan on changing them?</b><br>
“In Richmond, we actually have the highest seniors’ poverty rate.” <br><br>

Mr. Miao plans to lower Richmond’s seniors’ poverty rate, which was recorded to be the highest among cities in British Columbia in recent years. <br><br>

“Most people think that Richmond [is home to] many residents that are wealthy, but in fact, this is misleading information.” <br><br>

Due to the rampant rise in misinformation in the media, Mr. Miao hopes to alleviate this problem. <br><br>

<b>What makes you unique from other candidates in your riding? </b><br>
“I come from a unique cultural background that helps me relate to the different people I talk to in my community.” <br><br>

Other than possibly being the youngest candidate in the west coast, Mr. Miao has a diverse family history in Eastern Asia which has helped him understand and empathize with a lot of voters in his riding. <br><br>

<b>How has your experience in business and communications prepared you for a political career? </b><br>
“They brought in a lot of skill sets that I can utilize now.” <br><br>

According to Mr. Miao, his background in business and communications has helped him grow his network and understand different aspects of his community. This way, he learned how to identify the areas that require improvement in his community. <br><br>

<b>What do you think are some unique challenges to this election and how do you plan on addressing these difficulties? </b><br>
“This election is only for a period of 36 days.” <br><br>

Not only do Canadians have an unprecedented federal election arriving soon, but they are also given a mere 36 days to listen to politicians’ campaigns. Due to this time constraint, Mr. Miao has been using a mobile office to help him reach his constituents.  <br><br>

<b>Are mandatory vaccinations important and is it something that your party will decree? </b><br>
“Our party leader, Justin Trudeau, [is] suggesting [to] every Canadian to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible.” <br><br>

Mr. Miao believes that he and his party will ensure a proper pandemic recovery plan, one that helps many Canadians. As for himself, Mr. Miao received both doses of the coronavirus vaccine so that, by the time of his campaign launch, he was able to confidently approach his constituents and supporters. <br><br>

<b>What role do you think students play in this upcoming election?</b><br>
For students who are not yet eligible to vote, Mr. Miao highly recommends that they engage in the political process by volunteering. On that note, he advises that students do not become disappointed if they are turned down because rejections can help students learn how to do better next time and because there are many opportunities to help the community.
