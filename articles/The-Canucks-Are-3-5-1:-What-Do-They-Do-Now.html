            The Canucks Are 3-5-1: What Do They Do Now?
        </div>

        <div class="article">
            After emerging from a record setting 6 game road trip to start off their 2021-2022 season, the Canucks have endured 3 straight losses at home. It’s clear from the perspective of someone who has watched every single one of these games, that they are in trouble. <br><br>

Aside from the apparent stars, Connor Garland (8) and Thatcher Demko (35), the team seems lost. Their play is dominated by being hemmed in their own zone for almost all the game and they lack the quick puck movement required for successful breakouts. <br><br>

On top of that, their star players are underperforming. After being split up for most of the road trip, the Lotto line was reunited Saturday night against Edmonton, but to no avail. Of utmost concern is centreman Elias Pettersson (40), who only holds a measly 1 goal and 2 assists to his name. The club’s special teams have completely fallen apart, with a lackluster Penalty Kill, and a stagnant powerplay. Even if the first unit can break into the zone, it seems that the opponents’ PK can easily predict their moves. <br><br>

What does this all boil down to? They are simply too easy to play against. It appears that the system employed by head coach Travis Green is not working, and it is time for a change. <br><br>

On paper, the reformed roster orchestrated by GM Jim Benning looked like it was going to re-invent this team for the 2021-2022 season. It is true that there is no lack of talent and skill, with a top 6 holding the rawest ability the team has seen in almost a decade. When you look at the following lines, you wouldn’t think they would currently be last in the NHL’s weakest division: <br><br>

Beoser-Miller-Pettersson <br><br>

Hoglander-Horvat-Garland <br><br>

Pearson-Dickinson-Podkolzin <br><br>

Chiasson-Dowling-Highmore <br><br>

This organization has not possessed a similar amount of forward depth since the early 2010s. <br><br>

Yet, what we are seeing in every game is a system that just doesn’t work anymore. Asides from bursts of speed from players such as Horvat, Garland, and Hoglander, their play looks devoid of effort. Almost all their wins (except against a crippled Chicago Team) have been single-handedly robbed by supreme goaltending from Thatcher Demko. <br><br>

Not only does the team constantly dump and chase the puck, but they also can’t play a full 60-minute game, chronically giving up the first goal, and inevitably chasing the other team. It's frustrating to watch because you know that those players are capable of so much more. Gone are the days of the Sedins’ and Burrows’ first line chemistry, but one can expect at least proficient cycling from a line paid a solid percent of your cap. <br><br>

Yes, it is early in the season, but the Edmonton Oilers are already 5pts ahead whilst having played 2 less games. A coaching change could be what refreshes and energizes this team to achieve their full potential. Compared to previous coaches trusted at the helm of this organization, Green has had a lot more time. Yet, in his tenure, the team has only seen one successful playoff series win. <br><br>

With Tyler Motte set to start practicing with the club, and Travis Hamonic reporting to Abbotsford, GM Benning needs to act quickly to turn their play around. Travis Green has had his shot, but he doesn’t seem to be able to extend past the bounds of an AHL level coach. <br><br>

Coaching plays an essential role in the transition between an NHL team, a playoff team, and a cup contender. Travis Green’s stale system places the club way off their target.
