            Tokyo 2020 Olympics Recap: Best Moments & Notable Accomplishments

            Were you among the tens of millions across the world that tuned in to the Summer Games this year? Well, we know that the 16-hour time difference brought joy to just about nobody, so here’s an overview of special moments that sparked international acclamation and accomplishments that left their mark on history:<br><br> 

4 sports make their Olympic debut. Tokyo 2021 featured a record-breaking total of 33 sports, spanning 339 medal events, with the additions of skateboarding, surfing, karate, and sport climbing. Accompanying new disciplines included men’s and women’s three-on-three basketball, the BMX cycling freestyle, as well as a new category for mixed-gender teams in events like swimming and track and field. <br><br>

14-year-old Chinese diver Quan Hongchan scores perfect 10s. Had the Tokyo Olympics not been postponed by a year, Chinese diver Quan Hongchan wouldn’t have even been eligible to compete. But having turned 14 just months before, Quan became the second-youngest Chinese diver ever to take gold for her country after finishing the 10m women’s individual with a comfortable lead of 466.20 points, while her teammate Chen Yuxi claimed silver with 425.40 points. Born in a rural village in China’s Guangdong province, Quan has stated in various news reports that she’d only chosen to dive in order to help assist with her mom’s medical bills. From joining the sport at 7 and making the provincial team in 2018, she has truly shown that any child, regardless of financial privilege, can stand at the top of the Olympic podium at just the age of 14. <br><br>

Simone Biles prioritizes mental health—while sending a global message. Arriving in Tokyo as the star of not only Team USA but arguably the Games itself, the 24-year-old gymnast made headlines after withdrawing from the all-around finals due to mental health concerns. “My mental and physical health is above all medals that I could ever win,” she stated afterward, opening up about a condition that gymnasts call "twisties" — a frightening state of disassociation that prevents athletes from completing a skill, often leading to serious injury. Biles’ withdrawal was met by a torrent of international support praising her decision to prioritize her well-being, a sentiment echoed by many fellow athletes back at the Olympic Village as well. Simone later returned to compete in the Beam Finals where she won her second bronze and seventh Olympic medal, tying her as the most-decorated female gymnast of all time. <br><br>

A record-breaking number of LGBTQ athletes, more than triple the number from 2016, competed in Tokyo. Over 180 publicly out gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, and nonbinary athletes participated in the 2021 Summer Olympic Games, the massive increase reflecting the growing acceptance and appreciation for the LGBTQ+ community in society. At least 30 different countries were represented by an LGBTQ athlete, with the United States accounting for nearly a fifth of the total attendees. Among the well-known stars are British diver (and gold medalist) Tom Daley, Canadian soccer player Quinn, and New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard - the latter two both being openly transgender. <br><br>

PAF Sergeant Hidilyn Diaz wins Philippine's first gold medal. The Southeast-Asian nation erupted in a frenzy when Diaz, a four-time Olympian and silver medalist at the 2016 Rio Olympics, took home gold after setting a new world record in the women’s 55kg weightlifting event. “We will carve Hidilyn Diaz’s name in the Philippines’ history,” said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque at a media briefing. The statement, however, came in sharp contrast to the legal proceedings that took place back in 2019, when Diaz found herself among the list of people accused of allegedly plotting against Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Now, officials have only praise for the woman that finally brought home Olympic gold after a near-century long wait for a nation that has participated in the Summer Games since 1924. <br><br>

China, USA, and Australia all broke world records in a single race. The women’s 200m freestyle relay added one to the history books. Not only did China, which took home gold, touch the wall at a new world record of 7:40.33, but the United States and Australia who in turn claimed silver and bronze also both broke the previous world record of 7:41.50 set by Australia back in 2019. The close but clear margin was in particular due to the skill of Team USA's Katie Ledecky, who moved her team from bronze to silver position within the final leg, a slight disappointment for gold favorites Australia, who finished with a time of 7:41.29. <br><br>

Canadian women’s soccer team wins historic gold. From back-to-back bronze medals and years of near-misses, the Canadian women's soccer team came into the Tokyo Olympics with one goal: change the color of the medal. And they did just that. After a match that ended in a 1-1 draw, Canada managed to defeat Sweden 3-2 on penalty kicks to claim the country's first-ever gold medal in women's soccer. This year, the color is gold.
