            What is Education Like in the World’s Happiest Country?

            Education can be a decisive factor when considering the level of satisfaction one has in one’s life. One attaining higher education can mean achieving one’s dreams, living flourishing lives, and being rewarded for one’s commitments. However, the relationship between happiness and education can rather become tainted, where higher levels of education no longer associate with higher levels of happiness, due to increased levels of stress, competition, and anxiety. <br><br>

In order to gain a better understanding of what humans deem as ‘good life’ and how life satisfaction is linked to education, below is a description of education in the happiest country, which was determined according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Better Life Index.<br><br> 

<b>Happiest Country: Finland</b><br>

Ranking 1st out of forty countries part of the OECD, Finland also ranks as the top country in terms of education. According to the OECD, Finns between the ages of 5 and 39 expectedly pursue 20 years of education. Finland is home to a competitive climate where teaching is one of the most popular professions.<br><br> 

<b>The Education System in Finland&mdash;No Standardized Tests</b><br>

Finland offers a unique system of education to its students. Contrary to how students in the United States take the SAT before applying to university, Finland has no standardized tests. Where Americans use standardized tests to determine mastery and comprehension of core subjects, such as English and Math, Finland chooses not to solely teach students to pass one test. <br><br>

Moreover, extensive training for teachers in Finland results in a highly prized education system in the world and serves as the foundation for teacher autonomy, allowing teachers to teach with whichever method they think is best. Teaching programs in Finland are among the most rigorous professional programs in the country. In addition, teachers in Finland do not see the educational system as one Darwinian competition, but rather as one that thrives through cooperation and collective effort, resulting in classrooms embracing an environment of cooperation, not competition. <br><br>

<b>Student Life in Finland</b><br>

Finns start school at the age of seven and are required to attend only 9 years of school. Attending schools beyond the ninth grade or at the age of sixteen is optional. <br><br>

Furthermore, according to the OECD, students in Finland receive the least amount of homework than any other student in the world. In some ways, reducing the load of homework allows Finnish students to grow and excel in school without additional pressure. <br><br>

<b>The Matriculation Test and Finnish Universities</b><br>

In contrast to how there is a greater dichotomy between university and community college or trade schools in America, in Finland, both universities and trade schools are seen as equally professional options. Those who are willing to attend university can attend the Upper Secondary School, a two to four year program that helps students study for the Matriculation Test, a test that determines their acceptance into university. The Matriculation Examination consists of a minimum of four tests, one of which tests a student’s knowledge of his or her mother language, namely the Finnish, Swedish, and Sami language. The remaining three tests are chosen by the student among four tests: second national language, foreign language, mathematics, and humanities and natural sciences. <br><br>

Lastly, students have the option of enrolling in vocational education, a three-year program that provides training and education to students for various careers. <br><br>

<b>Happiness and Education</b><br>

Although it is difficult to conclude that better quality of education leads to more happiness, as happiness can be determined by a variety of factors, Finland serves as one noteworthy example of a country whose education and life satisfaction are among the top in the world. Finland encourages a more relaxed and less strenuous atmosphere within schools, which, in some ways, is a reason why Finnish students are generally more happy. Giving students a variety of options and avoiding mandatory measures allows Finnish students to also be more free and independent. As a result, education proves to be one dominant factor in measuring the quality of life not only because it influences one’s future, but also because it directly impacts youth development and growth during the early stages in one’s life. <br><br>

<b>Students' Perspectives</b><br>

Education is an integral factor that influences the happiness of students. Pursuing higher education is often considered a safe path to being financially stable as well as living a fulfilling life. However, it is also important to recognize that education does not always mean happiness. As a result, keeping a healthy balance between education and other aspects of life can be helpful in discovering one's desired purpose and passion.
