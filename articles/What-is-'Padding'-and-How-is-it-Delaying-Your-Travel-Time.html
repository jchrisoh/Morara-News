            What is &#39;Padding&#39; and How is it Delaying Your Travel Time?

            Flights seem to take longer and longer as years go by while the distance between airports haven't changed. People take longer to fly due to what is referred to as padding, where airlines outline flights to be intentionally longer due to common delays and setbacks. Should people be mad for being tricked? <br><br>

<b>Airlines are Tricking You </b><br>

For the past decade, airlines have chosen to extend their schedules instead of improving efficiency. This is why passengers often arrive on time despite taking off later than the intended time. While this may be a harmless action that airlines can take, this can also have a greater reaching impact on society. <br><br>

<b>Potential Harms </b><br>

The most obvious problem is that this action, when done routinely, creates a culture and habit for airlines across the globe to have little motivation to improve their efficiency and productivity. Not only does this sacrifice innovation and potential growth in the airline industry, but also it extends the damage that flights can have on the environment. <br><br>

Another issue is congestion at airports. With various airlines utilizing this same tactic, airports will be overwhelmed with planes trying to land at the same time. This not only harms the airline companies who face delays in preparing for upcoming flights, but also, individual passengers face delays at airports which can result in frustration. <br><br>

It's also important to realize that airlines are not solely to blame. Airlines can always improve efficiency and productivity yet still face unexpected obstacles such as poor weather conditions, a late passenger, or air traffic. People may find it frustrating, however, airlines feel equally if not more frustrated of delays as they worry about passengers becoming angry or never using their airlines again. With a little bit of understanding, both passengers and airlines can have a mutually beneficial relationship. <br><br>

<b>Possible Solutions on the Rise </b><br>

One solution that may interest the public is that of improving the air traffic control to better adjust with modern society. This is one of the most promising solutions as, when done correctly, it can solve a variety of problems such as reducing flight delays, decreasing the amount of fuel burned, and decreasing congestion both in the air and at airports. <br><br>

However, airlines are cautious in investing in new technology due to fear of air travel being abruptly halted due to global pandemics or unforeseen circumstances and have also had mixed results in the past from investing large funds of money into certain technology. This is uniquely the case for airlines who solely rely on the physical presence of their customers in order to earn profits, unlike other big corporations who have alternative means of earning revenue. <br><br>

<b>Students' Perspectives </b><br>

This concept of padding in the airline industry serves an important lesson to students. It reminds students of the importance of questioning details that are often neglected and ignored, even when it seems clear that there is something odd going on. This type of questioning is important not because it can create criticism, but because it allows students to be imaginative and explore multiple ways to solve a problem or to view an abstract idea. <br><br>

Moreover, this problem in the airline industry teaches students the importance of being considerate and understanding—being able to place oneself in another person's shoes. If people across the globe were just a bit more understanding and considerate of each other's circumstances and opinions, it may help the public solve problems such as these as well as ones that require international cooperation. It is especially important for students—the future generation—to learn this skill to change society in the future as it is more difficult for adults to change their old patterns.
