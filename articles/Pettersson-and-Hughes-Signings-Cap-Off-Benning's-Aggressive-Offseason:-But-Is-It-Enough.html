            Pettersson and Hughes Signings Cap Off Benning's Aggressive Offseason: But Is It Enough?

            It was announced this morning that the Vancouver Canucks has locked up their two franchise players Elias Pettersson and Quinn Hughes. The announcement arrives after Canucks fans underwent a grueling offseason, waiting for a contract for both players to be inked. <br><br>

Represented by agent Pat Brisson, the players agreed to a 3 years by 7.35 million bridge deal for the Swedish centre, and a 6 years by 7.85 million contract for the American defense men. <br><br>

It seems that General Manager Jim Benning’s tenacity and choice to play the long game paid off, with the reached agreements favouring both sides equally. After the three years, Elias Pettersson will remain a restricted free agent, allowing the Canucks to have exclusive bargaining rights for his next contract. With the longer-term deal met with Hughes, the Canucks have effectively bought one of his unrestricted free agent years giving them extra time with the player. <br><br>

The two players missed all of head coach Travis Green’s exhaustive training camp, instead deciding to train alongside Ottawa Senator’s star Brady Tkachuk in Michigan. With these two RFA signings, Pettersson and Hughes leave Tkachuk behind as the only notable restricted free agent unsigned. <br><br>

It is unclear whether missing a training camp will have an adverse effect on the player’s output or the team’s synergy this coming puck drop in Edmonton on October 13th. Pettersson’s line mate Brock Boeser underwent a similar contract hold out in 2019, missing the start of a training camp. The Canucks are desperate to at minimum hold a playoff position, and a strong start to this season may give the team the motivation they need. Coach Green illustrated his sentiments regarding their hold out: <br><br>

"I'm disappointed they're not here obviously as a coach. We got a lot of new bodies on our team. I think being two big pieces to our team it's important they're here, and obviously being two younger players, training camp is a big part of working on certain parts of your game and these are two young players that are vital to our team." <br><br>

Many fans questioned Jim Benning’s offseason moves and choice to leave the Pettersson and Hughes contracts to the end. However, his aggressive trades and acquisitions breathe new life into the team. Benning exchanged the long disappointing Loui Eriksson, Antoine Roussel, and Jay Beagle, for defensemen Oliver Ekman-Larsson and forward Conor Garland. The acquisitions of Tucker Poolman, Luke Schenn and Jason Dickinson strive to transform the last place team into a cup contender. <br><br>

However, their success undoubtedly rides on the shoulders of their star players. After developing a wrist injury last season, Elias Pettersson missed 30 games, and the team slowly plummeted in the standings. However, in the 26 games he played, he held a solid 21 points. Hughes leads all Canucks’ defensemen in points, but many criticize his defensive prowess. To continue to grow as a player, he needs to strengthen both sides of his game. <br><br>

As the Canucks are set to ice a strong line up of forwards, many fans worry about the blue line Benning established over the off-season. Although many agree it is a noticeable improvement over last season, they are not sure if it is enough to make them a true contender. However, with Pettersson and Hughes locked up and ready to play, October 13th can’t come soon enough.
