            How a Student Got Into Harvard
        </div>

            <br>
            <b>Introduction</b>:<br>
Owen Ebose is a senior at Burnaby North Secondary who will be attending Harvard in Fall 2021. Owen has always been passionate about politics and activism; since elementary school, Owen has been running a non-profit organization called Youth Empowerment Canada. Outside of service and volunteerism, Owen enjoys playing and coaching basketball. A fun fact about Owen is that he has two cats and is a professional actor. <br><br>

<b>How Do You Feel After Getting Into Harvard?</b><br>
“One word—excited.” <br><br>

<b>What Kinds of Tests Did You Take and Submit to Harvard?</b><br>
“This year, most schools went test-optional.” <br><br>

In 2020, since most universities did not require taking standardized tests, such as the SATs or the SAT Subject Tests, Owen chose not to submit standardized test scores to Harvard. Owen, however, did submit his AP exam scores as well as his high school transcript. <br><br>

<b>What Would You Say was the Strongest Component of Your Application?</b><br>
“My application focused heavily on climate activism; I have dedicated much of my high school career to protecting the environment, so I tied my experiences into the Common Application personal statement.” <br><br>

Owen emphasizes the importance of crafting a diverse and interesting applicant profile, which can be done by including and exploring different aspects of one’s personality. For example, Owen wrote about his acting career and his time coaching basketball. <br><br>

“One thing is clear: there is simply no magic formula when it comes to college applications.” <br><br>

After submitting his application, Owen took a look at some Common Application essay guides, and realized that he had broken every rule in the book. Owen wants to note that his acceptance shows that colleges are looking for students who can express their interests and achievements in a unique way. <br><br>

<b>Do You Have Any Plans for the Future?</b><br>
“As mentioned earlier, I am deeply passionate about the environment. I am also interested in politics, so something related to public policy with a focus on the climate would make sense. Law school is another option, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.” <br><br>

<b>Any Tips for Other Students Who May be Applying to an Ivy League School?</b><br> 
“Do not get caught up in fancy guides or editing services. Your application should be a reflection of the experiences that define who you are.” <br><br>

Owen explains how it is important to take plenty of time to think about your essays and that it is a good idea to start early. <br><br>

“After completing the application, you should take a step back and think about the profile you’ve put together. Look at your work through the eyes of an admissions officer. After doing so, you should be left with nothing but confidence.”
