        <div class="article">
            Last Friday Marvel released its much anticipated 25th film “Eternals.” Needless to say, the expectations were high leading up to its release. Not only was it directed by the reigning Best Director winner Chloé Zhao, but the lead producer at Marvel Studios Kevin Feige touted it as a potential Best Picture Contender.<br><br> 

Now will it win best picture at the Oscars? <br>

No. <br><br>

Will it even be nominated? <br>

No. <br><br>

Is it one of the best Marvel Movies? <br>

Maybe. <br><br>

I thoroughly enjoyed the film; it truly felt like no other Marvel project. The 47% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes fails to paint the whole picture surrounding the story. Now before I go deeper into why the philosophical debate crafted by Zhao is refreshing for the MCU, I beg you to go and watch it for yourself in the theatre. The experience of watching it on the big screen is like no other. <br><br>

Now with that, I can move into spoiler territory. <br><br>

Of course, no movie is perfect and there are definitely some glaring problems. For example, the deviants in general felt a bit rushed and elements of their characterization create a few plot holes. Don’t get me wrong, their design was incredible; but the explanation behind their abilities failed to ground them in reality. Sure, any comic book film requires some amount of suspension of disbelief, but that wanted a bit too much. <br><br>

Zhao made the clear decision to make something unique, and to stray from the Marvel model. Yes, the film can be slow at times, and prioritizes character development and human interactions over fan service and action; but that’s exactly what I personally enjoyed about it. For some, that was a deal breaker, but for me it only heightened the enjoyment. <br><br>

Specifically, aside from Thanos, Ikarus (Richard Madden) plays the role of one of the most morally well developed villains the MCU has ever seen. Not only did I not see the twist coming, but it was also essential in compounding the philosophical conflict at the core of the film. <br><br>

After millions of years spent defending and learning from the people of earth, the Eternals realize that their mission was in actuality a plot to birth another celestial from the core of this planet. That may sound kind of crazy, but Zhao uses this premise to explore the idea of faith versus moral righteousness. <br><br>

Ikarus chooses the path of faith, trusting the wishes of Arashem, but in the process remains somewhat loyal to his family. Nothing is black and white. Ikarus truly believes and trusts the wishes of Arashem, who he feels knows all the answers; nevertheless, he still can’t bring himself to kill his family. This is climaxed in the scene, where Ikarus is physically unable to use his laser eyes on Sersi (Gemma Chan) no matter how hard he tries. That scene in particular stood out to me the most, as it conveys the human race’s ambiguity. Even if one decides to act in a certain way, deep down there are intrinsic moral values that stop us. <br><br>

Although Ikarus and Sersi choose two contrasting sides of the argument, the other characters’ actions show that there aren’t two sides to any argument. Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), in a completely relatable fashion, chooses to check himself out of the whole decision. Although he believes Arashem, he loves his family more, and wouldn’t do anything to harm them. As a result, he leaves the conflict all together. <br><br>

Phastos (Bryan Tyree Henry), who was the first openly gay character in a Marvel film, portrays the parental perspective. To him, the lives of his husband and kids outweigh the possibility that trusting Arashem could be correct. Familial bonds sometimes blind people’s moral compasses. <br><br>

Lastly, the character Sprite (Lia McHugh) delivers one of the best lines in the film: “Why did Arashem make me like this… [humans] remind me of things I didn’t even know I wanted.” This quote shows why she made the decision to follow Ikarus. For her, her jealousy towards those who had everything she didn’t drove her mad. <br><br>

Yes, the film does not perfectly execute all of its ideas, but I applaud its ambition. Nowadays, it is difficult to come by a mainstream film that is smart, provocative, humanistic and compassionate. I wouldn’t expect anything less from Zhao.<br><br>
