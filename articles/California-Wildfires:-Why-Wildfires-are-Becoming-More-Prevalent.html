            California Wildfires: Why Wildfires are Becoming More Prevalent

            Firefighters work tirelessly to contain the recent wildfires in California, British Columbia, and more. The wildfires in California have been continuing for weeks, significantly affecting the local residents and regional air quality.<br><br> 

<b>California Wildfires </b><br>

The wildfire season of California in 2020 is especially devastating. There have been 7900 wildfires in California since the beginning of the year. By the end of June, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection had responded to nearly double the number of fires than it had in the entire 2019 season. Thousands of people were forced to evacuate from their residences. Recently, the North Complex Fire, the eighth largest fire in California’s history, has been burning for nearly a month and has caused 15 casualties. <br><br>

<b>Causes of California Wildfire</b> <br>

One important factor of the California wildfire is climate change. This August is the warmest for California in history. According to research, global warming doubled the number of wildfires in 2015. Due to global warming, the summers in California have become longer. When the dry summer drains the moisture of the forests, the trees become the ideal fuel for wildfires. A little spark can ignite and burn down the entire forest. As a result, fire can travel farther, increasing the difficulty of containing and controlling the wildfires. What is worse is that if the temperature continues to rise, the forest will become more arid and prone to fires in the future. <br><br>

Another factor of the California wildfire is human behaviour. According to studies, around 80 percent of wildfires are initiated by human behaviours such as leaving cigarette buds in the forest, playing with fireworks, and individuals choosing to commit arson. It is important to note that due to the dry environment of forests in the summer, a discarded cigarette is enough to spark a huge wildfire. <br><br>

<b>Impact on the Environment</b> <br>

Massive wildfires have detrimental effects on the environment. For example, fires can cause increased levels of carbon emission, leading to the production of greenhouse gases. This can increase the temperature of California’s summer, as well as the world’s, which might result in more wildfires in the future. This is a vicious circle that will lead to more hostile weathers and more forest damages. <br><br>

On the other hand, seasonal wildfires also play an important role in renewing and shaping the ecosystem. The fires can remove trees infected by diseases, litters, and brushes. This encourages the growth of new seedlings and maintains the well-being of the forests. <br><br>

<b>Students' Perspectives </b><br>

The situation can be challenging to students, as worse air quality can lead to less ventilation in crowded areas, such as classrooms and transit stations. Ventilation is crucial especially with the current situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As most students gradually return to school this week, the wildfire imposes greater risk to students’ health. To deal with the wildfire smoke, students can reduce outdoor activities, drink more water, and wear N95 masks. <br><br>

If you live close to a fire-prone area, you can prepare an emergency bag in case a fire takes place. It is also important to keep all the flammable materials, including brush, weed, and fuels, away from your house and your yard. If a fire breaks out, the optimum option is to leave immediately. These precautions can protect your life as well as your properties. <br><br>

The wildfire in California chokes the air of Vancouver. The air quality index of Vancouver is 10+, which is the highest rating of pollution. According to the AQHI scale, people, especially those with respiratory problems, should avoid strenuous activities outdoors to protect themselves from pm2.5––particulate matter which can cause health problems. Moreover, the recent fire in New Westminster has worsened air quality. As a result, it is important to be mindful of your behavior in the forest and to be cautious when outdoors during a wildfire.
