            The Debate Over the Eurozone: Should It Be Abolished?
        </div>

            <b>What is the Eurozone?</b><br>

The Eurozone, commonly referred to as the Euro, is the common currency of 19 member states of the European Union. The Euro is essentially run by the European Central Bank, which is located in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and carries out similar roles as other national central banks. <br><br>

<b>What Are Its Benefits?</b><br>

The primary benefit of having the Euro is that it is convenient to use between states when trading. This is beneficial for individuals who simply need to spend money in different countries, for prosperous businesses that trade in different regions, and even for governments, which can loan and borrow large sums of money much more easily. For example, countries that use the Euro are able to pay lower interest rates and do not have to exchange their currency into other currencies through a bank which take commissions off these transactions. <br><br>

In addition, the Euro is a massive incentive for foreign bodies and institutions to invest in European countries. This is because the Euro is seen as an extremely safe investment for potential investors because the investments are spread across the Eurozone countries, and investments can only disappear once every Eurozone country is to default which is highly unlikely. Through the support of foreign investments, which often takes the form of institutions purchasing Euro bonds, smaller countries in Europe such as Italy and Greece are able to manage poor financial situations. <br><br>

<b>What are the Harms to European Nations Using the Eurozone?</b><br>

The biggest cause for concern of the Euro is that every European country using the Euro is distinct in terms of their economy, industry and interest. For example, high growth countries may want to have increased interest rates, while low growth countries lower interest rates to incentivize investments. Unfortunately, because the Euro is predominantly controlled by the European Central Bank, individual Eurozone countries cannot control their debt during a financial crisis and cannot devalue their currency or even modulate inflation. <br><br>

A common action taken by multiple governments across the globe is deficit spending. For example, as part of the response to COVID-19, the United States of America required trillions of dollars, and that was only possible because the government was able to ask the United States central bank to buy government bonds in exchange for money. The exclusive benefit of having national banks is that the interest rate is very low and there is no due date as to when the money needs to be paid back. However, with the Euro, individual states cannot monetize their debt because they do not have their own central bank, and the European Central Bank is not going to buy government bonds from different countries. This makes it difficult for governments to adequately respond in times of crisis and to run a strong economy despite having some debt. <br><br>

<b>What Are Potential Alternatives?</b><br>

Advocates of abolishing the Euro explain that countries could either recreate common currencies with European countries that are similar economically. Others argue that countries should revert to a unique domestic currency so that countries that are geographically closer or countries that mainly export goods could form common currencies. For other countries, they can have full control of their individual currencies and access benefits such as controlling interest rates. <br><br>

<b>Can the Eurozone be Fixed?</b> <br>

Many countries and European leaders understand that the Eurozone is not perfect and have offered potential reforms that have yet to be enacted. For example, increasing the European Recovery Fund to be able to provide more financial support or even providing more flexibility for Eurozone countries to control monetary policies during an economic crisis is a possibility.
