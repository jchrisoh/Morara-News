        <div class="article">
            <br>
            <b>Introduction</b>:<br>
Saba Fadai is a grade 11 student at White Oaks Secondary School, Oakville, Ontario. Saba is the president of the Junior Optimist Club of Oakville, which consists of over 90 members, vice-president of logistics of the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), and is an active competitor in her school’s DECA Finance chapter. She is passionate about a wide array of activities such as photography, music, dancing, and sports. She has also taken interest in business, entrepreneurship, and leadership, and plans to explore different areas of interest in the near future. <br><br>

<b>What Does the Junior Optimist Club Do?</b><br>
“We are always looking for ways to make a difference in our community with our optimism, which helps us grow even more.” <br><br>

Junior Optimist Club is a non-profit community service organization dedicated to bringing out the best in youth, in our communities and in ourselves. The club selects projects and activities to pursue in trying to improve the lives of youth in Oakville. <br><br>

Not only does this benefit those receiving such support, but it also benefits those who are members of the club who are able to accumulate different experiences and volunteer hours through diverse opportunities. <br><br>

Saba notes how her JOI organization has been awared as a Distinguished Honour JOI for the past 5 years in a row, which is the highest achievement a JOI can attain from Optimist International. <br><br>

<b>What Leadership Skills Have Helped You Successfully Lead the JOI?</b><br>
“In addition to optimism and innovation, being a good role model for people to follow and rely on is crucial.” <br><br>

<b>What Made You Start a Future Business Leaders of America Club?</b><br> 
“I felt like I could not feel fulfilled without having the FBLA club at my school.” <br><br>

Saba, having volunteered at FBLA Canada with one of her friends, was able to meet several great leaders who demonstrated dedication and hardwork in pursuing the goals that would help others. Saba wished to cultivate an atmosphere of engaged and like-minded student leaders that could also feel what she felt at FBLA Canada. <br><br>

<b>Could You Explain the Process of Founding White Oak's FBLA Club?</b><br>
“It was difficult at first having to meticulously plan the details of the club and preparing an energetic executive to ensure that the club can run smoothly.” <br><br>

As many can relate, starting a new club is an incredibly arduous task with many barriers such as needing a sponsor teacher or preparing large amounts of resources for new club members. It helped Saba to have a concrete goal throughout the entire process––establishing a strong business club at her school for all to enjoy. <br><br>

<b>What Were Some of the Biggest Challenges You Faced Throughout the Process?</b><br>
Saba explains that in addition to self–doubt, one of the greatest challenges was identifying the best students to join her new executive team to help guide this new club successfully into the future. She wanted to find individuals who were also passionate about business and could utilize their expertise to execute the goals of this new club. <br><br>

<b>What Skills were Crucial in FBLA's Success as a Club?</b><br>
“We need to be committed to what we are passionate about and our goals for the club as we have been for us to continue to succeed. It’s important to be efficient, resilient, innovative and strategic.” <br><br>

Through multiple clubs and initiatives, Saba has made a great impact around her community.
