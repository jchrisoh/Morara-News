            Climate&ndash;Induced Famine: Madagascar

            Tens of thousands of people are suffering catastrophic levels of starvation after years without rain instigated a near–nonexistent harvest season. <br><br>

Madagascar is experiencing its worst drought in four decades, with a recent estimate from the World Food Program (WFP) reporting 1.14 million people being food-insecure and around 400,000 people at risk of famine. <br><br>

On the brink of experiencing the world's first "climate change famine” is what the UN reports, the multilateral organization estimating 30,000 people among the country’s population to be suffering from the highest internationally recognized level of food insecurity, a number warned to double by October. Although the island nation is well accustomed to frequent tropical storms and changes in weather patterns, the latest IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) observed a stark increase in aridity. <br><br>

Increasing temperatures are disrupting weather patterns that farmers in the developing world have relied heavily upon for centuries. Monsoons are becoming increasingly unpredictable, wreaking havoc in places dependent on rain for agriculture. Some start earlier than usual, others appearing in the wrong place, but at times – not showing up at all. <br><br>

The impact of the drought has become acute in the southern part of the nation too, where children have taken to the streets to beg for food. <br><br>

“The prices in the market are going up - three or four times. People are selling their land to get money to buy food," said a charity worker in Tôlañaro. Farmers have even been sleeping in their cassava fields to protect the scarce crops from starving citizens driven by desperation. <br><br>

Though famines have historically resulted from crop failure caused by natural effects, modern famines are largely considered to be man-made, sparked by natural disasters or political interference. None of these apply to Madagascar, making it the first solely climate change-induced famine. <br><br>

"This is unprecedented. These people have done nothing to contribute to climate change. They don't burn fossil fuels… and yet they are bearing the brunt of climate change," said a member of the WFP. <br><br>

Among the poorest nations in the world, Madagascar has no capacity to invest in additional resources. To provide enough lifesaving food for the next lean season would require close to $100 million alone. <br><br>

As per the 2015 Paris Agreement, wealthy nations agreed to set aside $100 billion a year to help developing nations in climate financing. In the latest data release, donors were still short $20 billion. But even if we continue to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation, the issue plays us in the long run. <br><br>

“This famine in Madagascar, the heatwave in America, the floods in Germany, this is an indicator that climate change needs to be taken seriously,” says Landry Ninteretse, the director for climate organization 350.org. “In the same way the world reacted to the pandemic and were able to get vaccines in less than a year—If the world would have reacted in the same way when we started sending the first warning signals of climate change, the situation would be much better than what it is now.” <br><br>

Madagascar may be far away, but the same issues broadcasted over and over again on the news, begging people and governments to pay attention - those should hit close to home. Their people are on the verge of starvation, and without immediate action, seasonal famine will become a reality.
